Write a small Verilog module itmult that has two multibit outputs of size SIZE HM and LM which are the high and low bits of the result, two multibit inputs of size SIZE A and B which are the operands, one single bit output fin that signals the end of the iterative computation, and three inputs: start that tells the circuit when to use the input operands to calculate the product, so when start is zero it keeps copying the inputs A and B and when it switches to one it starts the multiplication which will take SIZE cycles. You will need to instantiate, possibly among other things, a register rregister to accumulate the result which has to be big enough to hold both the low and the high bits, a counter cntr to count the number of iterations, an adder yAdder and a two-to-one multiplexor yMux.
